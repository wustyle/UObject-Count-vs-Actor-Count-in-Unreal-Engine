# UObject Count vs Actor Count in Unreal Engine
Abstract  Unreal Engine gameplay systems are commonly implemented using an actor–component architecture, yet guidance on the performance implications of large actor and UObject counts is largely anecdotal. This study presents a controlled empirical evaluation of how actor count and component-driven UObject count affect runtime performance and memory behaviour in Unreal Engine.  A reproducible benchmark was constructed to independently scale actor count and total UObject count while minimizing confounding factors such as rendering, physics, AI, networking, and per-frame logic execution. Measurements were collected from packaged Shipping builds using engine-native profiling tools, capturing game thread execution time, CPU frame time, resident memory usage, garbage collection behaviour, and live UObject counts.  Results show that increasing actor count alone has minimal impact on average game thread execution time under minimal workload conditions. Increasing total UObject count via additional components similarly does not produce proportional runtime degradation, but results in substantial and consistent growth in resident memory usage. These findings indicate that actor count is a poor predictor of runtime cost, while UObject count is a dominant factor in memory scaling, providing empirical guidance for gameplay architecture decisions in Unreal Engine.
